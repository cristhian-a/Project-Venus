/**
 * The module declaration for the `engine.core` module.
 * <p>
 * This module serves as the core library for the engine framework, managing
 * functionalities such as data handling, events, graphics rendering, I/O,
 * sound processing, physics, animations, debugging, user interfaces,
 * and more. It provides the essential parts and services required to
 * operate the engine's systems effectively.
 * <p>
 * Requirements:
 * - The module has dependencies on several external libraries and modules,
 *   including Jackson for JSON processing, JSpecify for type annotations,
 *   and others such as Java Management and Java Desktop.
 * <p>
 * Features:
 * - Exports a wide range of packages for engine functionalities, allowing
 *   them to be used by external modules and applications.
 * - Opens specific packages to the `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind` module
 *   to support serialization and deserialization with Jackson.
